This version of N8ME's firmware has been modified as follows:
 * Added install-prereqs.sh script to put arduino toolchain in /opt/
 * Added GNU makefiles to allow building without arduino IDE and the java mess that entails.
 * Added support for LoRA based communication with ATU-100 and optional remote amplifier
