This is old.... You probably dont want it. Get N8ME's current spurces from groups.io, i dont have a working ubitx to maintain this on anymore...


This tree may sometimes be broken.. I'm working on adding a stripped down CAT-only build mode
which should save a significant amount of space by removing display and CW features.


So far we've gone from 30kbytes down to about 9kbytes. Plenty of room for ampduino symbiote ;)


All bugs are probably mine, so do not complain to N8ME.

Thanks for the great firmware, Mark!

This version of N8ME's firmware has been modified as follows:
 * Added install-prereqs.sh script to put arduino toolchain in /opt/
 * Added GNU makefiles to allow building without arduino IDE and the java mess that entails.
 * Added support for LoRA based communication with ATU-100 and optional remote amplifier

Once again, please do not ask N8ME for support with this version of the firmware!
